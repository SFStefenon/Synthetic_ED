# synthetic_ED

This repository presents a rule and statistical-based model for creating synthetic engineering drawings. The application of the proposed method is based on the generation of synthetic objects using generative artificial intelligence models. In particular, GANs, conditional GANs (cGANs), diffusion models, and conditional diffusion models are considered
